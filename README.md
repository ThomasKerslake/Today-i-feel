‘Today I feel’ is a nod / response towards the project named Emoti-os by I-DAT. Emoti-os made use of written communication to understand the collective emotions of its users, outputting an emotive face to represent the most prominent emotion. My project uses this concept with a more abstract approach, and rather than text, face detection is used to gage a user’s current emotion and output a visual representation of their emotion. The abstract representation has an element of uniqueness to it due to it altering slightly every time you visit or refresh the page. Expression displaying happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, surprise and a neutral expression can all be detected via your webcam as you interact with this project.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**
- You need a webcam to use / interact with this project (the project will still load without one, but will not allow for interaction). Furthermore, you also need to allow the project access of your webcam
- If you download this project and run into the issue of not being able to load the models, try removing the '.' from './modelname' in script.js.
- On your first time loading and running the project It may freeze for a few seconds, after that it should run smoothly.
- This project looks best on 1920x1080 screens.
- As well as interaction via a webcam, you are able to look around and move the render around by holding right or left click down and moving your mouse. Furthermore you can zoom in and out by scrolling forward or backward.
